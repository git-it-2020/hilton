# Andrew Ciccarelli created this app based on the following instructions that were provided to him 

This code challenge is based on creating a React application using Next.JS and should be written in TypeScript.

The application should be protected by an auth-wall that will redirect an unauthorized user to the login page (the website must not be accessible to unauthenticated users).

The login page will take a name as input and will just authenticate the user without any real business logic. The name provided will be stored in a session using a React context.

After the successful login we will display a simple page that will greet the user, using the name from the session, and will just show a list of posts retrieved from this endpoint.

Thank you for taking this challenge and we hope you will enjoy working on it.
